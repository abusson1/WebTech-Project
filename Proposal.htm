Project Proposal - Flynn Busson
</h1>

<p>
    What is your website about?<br><br>
    My website will be an informational website for a private real estate business. The website will allow perspective tenants to browse some of the most high-end apartments in the portfolio. People will be able to view improvements, rent-roll, and meet the management team. <br><br><br>
    What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)<br><br>
    The business has been receiving many inquiries that could be solved with a simple informational site. For instance, perspective tenants often reach out requesting simple information, and managers get overwhelmed dealing with repeated mundane requests.<br><br><br>
    Who is your target audience set?<br><br>
    The target audience will be perspective renters in Providence, RI, as well as potential investors looking for more information on the portfolio, or how to get involved in new investments.<br><br><br>
    What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?<br><br>
    The website will provide all relevant information about the properties, including the address of the building, available amenities, rent amount, and even a link to a downloadable tenant application. The website will also contain a link to a page informing perspective investors of how to get in touch with management, should they find a property worth investing in. <br><br><br><br><br>
